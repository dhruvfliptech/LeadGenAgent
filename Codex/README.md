## Codex Knowledge Base

This directory consolidates the pivot plan for transforming the Craigslist Lead Generation System into the AI-powered outreach and demo-platform defined in the 2.0 requirements. Each document is spec-driven and designed so individual squads can execute in parallel without ambiguity.

### Document Map
- `Software_Architecture_Blueprint.md` – Authoritative view of the end-state architecture, interfaces, and infrastructure.
- `System_Design_Pivot.md` – Detailed component-by-component design describing how the current system evolves into the target platform.
- `Epic_Roadmap.md` – Eight-week agile delivery plan including milestones, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.
- `UX_UI_Strategy.md` – Glassmorphism dashboard strategy, IA updates, interaction patterns, and component specifications.
- `Claude_Agent_Playbook.md` – Operational handbook for AI Council orchestration, Claude skill templates, and evaluation loops.
- `Data_and_API_Spec.md` – Unified database migrations, API contracts, analytics telemetry, and compliance requirements.
- `QA_and_Risk_Plan.md` – Validation strategy, environments, checkpoints, and risk mitigation.

### Usage Guidance
1. Start with the blueprint to align on architecture and service boundaries.
2. Use the system design to understand integration details and legacy touchpoints.
3. Plan execution with the epic roadmap, keeping risks and QA gates in view.
4. Reference specialized documents (UX, Claude, Data) during implementation of respective domains.

All documents assume Phase 0 (baseline hardening) is complete and that the team is entering the transformation epics.
