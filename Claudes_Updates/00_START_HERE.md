## 🎯 What To Do RIGHT NOW

### Option 1: Build MVP Today (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/greenmachine2.0/Craigslist/Claudes_Updates

# Open this file and follow hour-by-hour:
open 05_MVP_QUICK_START_GUIDE.md
```

**Result**: Working system with AI-powered analysis + email generation in 8 hours.

---

### Option 2: Understand Strategy First

```bash
cd /Users/greenmachine2.0/Craigslist/Claudes_Updates

# Read in this order (30 minutes):
1. README.md (you're here!)
2. 05_MVP_QUICK_START_GUIDE.md (skim the plan)
3. 03_COST_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md (understand economics)

# Then start building with Quick Start Guide
```

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made (Backed by Research)

### 1. Use LLM-as-Judge (Not RL-Factory)
- ❌ RL-Factory: Wrong use case (designed for tool-calling agents)
- ✅ LLM-as-Judge: Industry standard, 10x simpler, achieves same goals
- 📄 Research: `00_ML_STRATEGY_RESEARCH.md`

### 2. Semantic Routing (70-85% Cost Savings)
- Simple tasks → Ultra-cheap models ($0.14-0.27/M tokens)
- Complex tasks → Route by lead value
- Critical tasks → Always premium
- 📄 Guide: `03_COST_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md`

### 3. Docker Compose (Not Kubernetes)
- Internal tool (2 users) doesn't need K8s complexity
- 90% cost savings ($40/mo vs $500/mo)
- Can migrate to K8s later if needed
- 📄 Architecture: `01_ENHANCED_SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md`

### 4. MVP First (Scraping + Analysis + Email)
- Skip demo sites / video for now (Phase 2)
- Validate outreach approach first
- Add advanced features based on data
- 📄 Quick Start: `05_MVP_QUICK_START_GUIDE.md`

---

## 💰 Cost Projections (With Optimization)

### 100 Leads/Day
- **AI APIs**: $108/month
- **Hosting**: $40/month
- **Total**: $148/month (~$0.05/lead)

### 1000 Leads/Day
- **AI APIs**: $1,606/month
- **Hosting**: $80/month
- **Total**: $1,686/month (~$0.05/lead)

**Savings**: 70-85% vs using premium models for everything

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start Small
Don't try to build everything at once. Follow MVP guide → validate → expand.

### Tip 2: Track Costs from Day 1
AI-GYM tracking pays for itself. You'll optimize as you go.

### Tip 3: Use Both Doc Sets
Codex = strategic vision. Claudes_Updates = tactical implementation. Both are valuable.

### Tip 4: A/B Test Models
Let data guide your routing decisions. Track which cheap models approach premium quality.

### Tip 5: Optimize Prompts First
Before fine-tuning models, optimize prompts. 80% of quality comes from prompt engineering.
